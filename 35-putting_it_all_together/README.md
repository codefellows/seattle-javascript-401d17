====

## Learning Objectives
* students will be able to complete a full stack application (using the MERN stack)

## Readings
* read [url loader docs](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/url-loader/)
* read [svg vs icon fonts](https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/)

## Overview
* today's lecture is dedicated to adding the final layers of a modularized and component based MERN stack application *(Mongo Express React Node)*
* below, you can read up on some additional thing's we'll be using in our application, such as SVG icons and the url-loader for loading of static assets

#### url loader
* the `url-loader` can either copy an imported asset into the build path, or turn it into a DataURL
  * we've used this before to create an image preview link using the `FileReader` API

#### svg
* SVG stands for "scalable vector graphics"
* they are natively supported in HTML5
* by using SVG's you open the potential for much more styling control
  * inline SVG's offer the most control as every piece of the SVG can be modified
